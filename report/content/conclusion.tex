\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}
This chapter concludes our project. We do by first describing the results of our solution in \Cref{sec:results} and see if they actually answers our problem statement in \Cref{sec:problem_statement}. We will discuss the results in \Cref{sec:discussion} to conclude whether are the results we wanted and if some of the results are especially good or bad. Lastly we will discuss the further work and improvements that can be done with our system in \Cref{sec:furtherwork}.
