\section{Unit Testing}\label{sec:unittesting}
Throughout the development process we write unit tests for each class to assure that classes and their methods behave as expected. This is very beneficial due to the fact that the code changes often during the implementation of new features and refactoring of the current implementation. Tests are written without code coverage in mind, as we feel some parts of the system are trivial, and writing tests for those methods would be an inefficient use of resources. Our code is tested using the JUnit \cite{JUNIT} framework, version 4.11. 

\todo{Anything interesting related to unit tests goes here}

%\subsection{Tested classes}
%The producer classes are tested to make sure they live up to the expected output results, and that the aggregation scaling of the amount of windmills up and down has the desired affects.
%
%The main weather API class has tests to make sure the data requested are correct and on the right days from the desired location.
