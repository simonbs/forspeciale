\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:evaluation}
In this chapter, we evaluate on various aspects of the design and implementation processes, and the system as a whole. We do this by setting up cases, experimenting on different variables in these cases, and then evaluating their results on profit.

The first experiments we perform in \Cref{sec:profitexp} are to see how different cases affect a BRP's profit. We do this by testing three different cases and change the input parameters individually for each case, compute the profit and then compare the results. Then in \Cref{sec:evalperformance} we test the performance of the different implemented schedulers to see if they are viable in a large scale system with many EVs. We test the correctness of our forecaster in \Cref{sec:forecasteval} to see how well we forecast energy prices. As this project is a research project, we choose not to perform large scale unit tests to test our system for correctness.
