This report presents research in the area of balancing electrical energy for a company in the electric power industry. Balancing of production and consumption is done in a fictive scenario, where energy consumption is from electric vehicles and production is entirely composed of renewable energy sources.

To initiate this, a brief introduction of the energy balance domain is explored. To address balancing, we design a data structure representing flexible consumption, and use intelligent planning and forecasting of this consumption to achieve balance with optimal profit. Planning is however complex, and is thus hard to solve optimally. Our research shows that by scheduling consumption, and adapting to unpredictable production energy, we can significantly increase profit by an average of $12-\perc{13}$.
