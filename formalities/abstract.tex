This report presents a system that allows a person using a wearable device, such as a smartwatch, to point at smart devices and then control them by performing a gesture with his arm. We use a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy beacons (from Estimote), for indoor positioning, and a magnetometer for detecting the users orientation to determine which device the user points at. The smart devices are connected to a smart hub. We implement a server for handling the connection between the smart hub and the wearable. The server also keeps track of the device information from the smart hub, and the location of the smart device.

Our tests show that the Bluetooth Low Energy beacons provide an indoor positioning accuracy of \SI{2.92}{\meter}. This low accuracy means that we are only able to point to the correct device \perc{4.29} of the time.
