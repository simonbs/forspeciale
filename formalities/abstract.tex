This report presents a system allowing wearables, such as smartwatches, to control a smart home. The system allows a user, wearing a wearable, to point at smart devices, and then perform a gesture that maps to an action. We use Bluetooth Low Energy beacons (from Estimote), for indoor location, and a magnetometer, for direction, to determine which device the user points at. The smart devices are connected to a smart hub. We implement a server for handling the connection between the smart hub and the wearable. The server also keeps track of the device information from the smart hub, and the device's location. 

Our tests show that the Bluetooth Low Energy beacons provide a indoor location accuracy of \SI{2.92}{\meter}. This low accuracy means that we are only able to point to the correct device \perc{4.29} of the time.
