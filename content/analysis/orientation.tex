\section{Orientation}\label{sec:analysis:orientation}
In this project, a solution for pointing at a controllable device, \eg a lamp, is proposed. 
In order to determine which device the user points at, 
and thereby intends to control, 
it is necessary to determine the locations of the devices in the system, 
relative to the user. 
Thus we must know the location of the user, 
and his controllable devices along with the orientation of the user.

The orientation of the user can be retrieved from any device possessing a magnetometer. 
We found that \num{49} devices in Vandrico's database contain the magnetometer component. 
We also need to define a visibility range, 
\ie a range that constitutes the area in which items are visible to the system. 
This range can be specified (in degrees) as $r = o \pm e$, 
where $r$ is the visibility range, $o$ is the orientation of the user, 
and $e$ is the distance between $o$ and the edges of $r$.
\Cref{fig:visibilityangle} illustrates the visibility angle. 
In \Cref{fig:visibilityangle}, the user's orientation is \var{o1}, 
and there are two devices with orientations \var{o2} and \var{o3}. 
An orientation in degrees is between \num{0} and \num{360}. 
To determine whether a device with orientation \var{o2} is within the visibility range, 
it is a simple matter of calculating whether \var{o2} is greater than $\var{o1}-\var{e}$, 
and smaller than $\var{o1}+\var{e}$, 
with some exceptions when the visibility range spans the gap between 359\degree \ and 0\degree.

Given the user's location $(x1, y1)$ and the devices locations $(x2, y2)$ and $(x3, y3)$,
we can calculate the orientation of the devices (\var{o2} and \var{o3}), 
by finding the inverse tangent (arctangent), 
and then converting from radians to degrees (dividing \num{180} by $\pi$), 
such that we get the following equation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:angle}
\var{orientation} = 180 / \pi * \arctan((\var{user.y} - \var{device.y}) / (\var{user.x} - \var{device.x}))
\end{equation}
