\section{Indoor Positioning}\label{sec:analysis:indoor-positioning}

The focus of this project is not to position devices, 
and as such it was not the intention to spend time developing an entire solution for positioning devices indoors. 
Instead it was desired to find an existing product, 
that could be used to facilitate indoor positioning.
The solution had to be available in the early phases of the project, 
in order to start building the system based on the solution for positioning.

As the target group of the project is consumers, 
and not businesses with big budgets, 
it is desired that the price of the technology used for indoor positioning is kept at a minimum. 
This includes the price for any device, 
that may have to be installed on each controllable device in order to position it.

It is assumed that users already own one or more devices that fit within the concept of Internet of Things, 
and are early adapters of such technology. 
However, it easy to imagine that this project can be used in an office environment, 
where employees of varying technological expertise work or in health care. 
Therefore users may have a varying degree of technological expertise, 
and it should be easy to extend the solution with new controllable devices.

Naturally the accuracy of the solution used for indoor positioning plays an important part. 
\Cref{fig:indoor-positioning:incorrect} shows the consequence of an incorrect location. 
If a lamp is estimated to be at another location that it is actually located, 
the user must point to an incorrect location in order to control the lamp.
Furthermore if the estimate is too wide, 
\ie the given area in which the lamp is located is very big, 
there is a greater risk that locations overlap. 
Overlapping locations causes a complexity, 
as it is necessary to determine which device the user desires to control, 
if he points at the overlap as visualized in \Cref{fig:indoor-positioning:overlap}.

\subsection{Analysis of Potential Existing Solutions}
This section will be an analysis of commercialized products that offer indoor positioning.
Only solutions intended for indoor positioning are considered.
GPS is not considered a potential solution as GPS is meant for outdoor positioning, 
and the location offered by GPS tend to have poor accuracy indoors \cite{Liu:4343996}.
Furthermore WiFi is not considered, 
as analyses have shown the accuracy of such solutions to be \SI{2}{\meter} and above \cite{Liu:4343996,jekabsons2011analysis}, 
which is a high inaccuracy in a single room. 
Technologies like NFC and RFID were not considered for positioning in this project either. 
Such systems only detect users when they walk by the sensors, 
and then report which sensor was activated.
We were looking for technologies that provide a more granular position of the user. 

Furthermore, we have chosen not to include solutions designed for larger buildings such as airports, malls or warehouses, 
as these does not provide solutions or setups for smaller areas such as rooms or houses. 

\Cref{tbl:indoor-positioning} shows the results of our analysis.

Estimote gives a solution using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons using the iBeacon protocol. 
The beacons can be mounted on walls in a room or building, 
and then by using the signal strength of each beacon (an iBeacon feature), 
it can estimate how far away the user is. 
Estimote's solution is available as a consumer product.

Pozyx and DecaWave use a wireless radio technology known as ultra-wideband (UWB), 
which works much like BLE, 
but where the rising and failing of edges of the signals are much faster. 
Due to this, it is easier to better determine the signal strength, and thus the distance, 
between the transmitter and the receiver. 
See \cite{UWB} for a further description of why. 
Like Estimote, it also requires setting up ``anchors'', 
and then using the signal strength to find the location. 
No easy to use consumer product is available for either of these.

SmartActionSLAM is an Android application from research done by Hardegger \etal \cite{SASLAM}. 
This solution is a lot different from most other indoor positioning solutions. 
It \emph{calculates} an estimated location by counting steps and estimating step length and direction. 
In theory it can be adapted to almost any smartphone, 
but requires a lot of work to adapt the released code from the research project. 
The benefit of this solution is that no extra hardware is needed. 
SmartActionSLAM can run on the users smartphone, 
and with some adjustments, potentially on a wearable.
