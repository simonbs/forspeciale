\chapter{Implementation}\label{chap:implementation}
%\input{content/implementation/prototypes}
This chapter describes the implementation details of our system, 
designed in \Cref{chap:design}. 
The system consists of three tiers, as described by \Cref{fig:architecture}.
We designed the first tier to consist of a wearable device and a smartphone. 
However, since we did not have access to a wearable device, 
we have implemented the first tier \emph{entirely} as a smartphone application. 

This application have been developed through several prototypes. 
The first prototype, described in \Cref{sec:implementation:prototypes:prototype1}, 
was implemented as an Android application, 
to develop a way to find which devices the user points at. 
\Cref{sec:implementation:prototypes:prototype2} describes the second prototype was implemented as an iOS application,
developed to test communication with the server and control of the devices. 
We also developed a very basic server for this prototype, \ie the second tier. 
The third prototype in \Cref{sec:implementation:prototypes:prototype3}, 
implemented the \threedollar system,
and used the location estimated from the Estimote SDK. 
The fourth and final prototype described in \Cref{sec:implementation:prototypes:prototype4}, 
connected all the components of the system. 
This prototype connects to and communicates with the implemented server and smart hub. 

The final implementation of the server,
is described in \Cref{sec:serverimplementation}. 
As the smart hub, the third tier, is not something that we have implemented ourself, 
we will not describe the implementation of this.
However, \Cref{sec:serverimplementation} describes how it is connected to our system.
