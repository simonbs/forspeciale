\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}
In this ever changing world we rely more and more on electric appliances and electricity. Electricity companies struggle to keep up with the increasing demand for energy~\cite{ieoOutlook}. This increased consumption results in an increase in production, resulting in more pollution. To counter this pollution, we add more and more clean energy production from renewable energy sources, and we see our electric appliances become less energy demanding. A well known renewable energy source are wind turbines, generating electricity from wind energy. This is a cleaner alternative to e.g.\ coal, but it also comes with complications. 

This chapter dissects the most important topics, to get a better understanding of the problem domain. \Cref{sec:energy_imbalances} explains what energy imbalances are and why they are are problematic -- Especially with renewable energy sources. In \Cref{sec:MIRABEL} we analyze an existing system called \textsc{mirabel}, that deals with balancing energy production and energy demand. \Cref{sec:marketmodel} explains how the current energy market works and how balance responsible parties earn their money. A new technology called smart grids, will be described in \Cref{sec:smartgrids}. After analyzing the problem domain in the already mentioned sections, we will set up a problem statement in \Cref{sec:problem_statement}, which we will try to answer in the rest of the report. The requirements for our solution will be described in \Cref{sec:requirements}. Finally in \Cref{sec:overview}, we give an overview of the rest of the report where each chapter will briefly be explained.
