\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}
In recent years there has been a large increase in so-called \emph{smart devices}. 
A smart device is an electronic device that is connected to one or more other smart devices. 
Common protocols for the interconnection of smart devices are WiFi or Bluetooth, among others.
Smart devices are part of a concept called the Internet of Things, or IoT. 
IoT is a concept describing a network of physical devices, such as smart devices. 
Example of devices that are part of a network could be a coffee machine, a watch or even a refrigerator. 
Devices such as smartphones, laptops or servers, that are already commonly connected to the Internet, are usually not considered part of this IoT network. 

The IoT network recently became a reality when the IPv6 protocol was launched,
creating a total of $2^{128}$ unique IP addresses, 
so that devices such as a smart coffee machine could get its own unique IP address. 
One of the companies that quickly accepted IoT is Coca-Cola, 
who, already by 2010, reserved $16$ million IP addresses to use for \eg their vending machines around the world \cite{coke-iot}. 

We will use the remainder of this chapter to explore the technologies and uses of IoT. 
We start by analyzing wearables, \ie smart devices that are worn, in \Cref{sec:wearables}.
Another large part of IoT is the concept of smart homes, \ie homes that are partially or fully automated by utilizing smart technologies and devices. 
We will analyze this in \Cref{sec:smarthomes} where \Cref{sec:system-categories} describes different levels of home automation. 
Indoor location, described in \Cref{sec:indoor-positioning}, can play an important part in smart homes and automation.
Finally we propose a problem statement \Cref{sec:researchstatement} and give an overview of the rest of the report in \Cref{sec:overview}.
