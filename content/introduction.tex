\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}
In recent years there has been a large increase in so-called \emph{smart devices}. 
A smart device is an electronic device that is connected to one or more other smart devices. 
Common protocols for the interconnection of smart devices are WiFi or Bluetooth, among others.
Smart devices are part of a concept called the Internet of Things, or IoT. 
IoT is a network of physical devices, 
where the devices have unique identifiers and are connected to the Internet, 
making them accessible from other devices such as personal computers or smartphones. 
Example of devices that are part of a network could be an air condition unit, a coffee machine, a watch or a refrigerator. 
Devices such as smartphones, laptops or servers, 
that are already commonly connected to the Internet, 
are usually not considered part of the IoT network. 

We will in this chapter gain an insight of what is the current state of \emph{wearables} and \emph{smart homes}. 
We first describe the initial problem in \Cref{sec:initproblem}, 
that describes what information we are looking to explore and why. 
After describing this problem, we will analyze wearables, 
\ie smart devices that are worn, in \Cref{sec:wearables}.
Another large part of IoT is the concept of smart homes, 
\ie homes that are controlled or automated by utilizing smart technologies and devices. 
We will analyze smart homes in \Cref{sec:smarthomes}, 
where \Cref{sec:system-categories} describes different levels of home automation. 
Finally we propose a problem statement \Cref{sec:researchstatement}, 
and give an overview of the rest of the report in \Cref{sec:overview}.
