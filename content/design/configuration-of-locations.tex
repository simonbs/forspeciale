\section{Configuration of a Location}

Before indoor positioning can be performed, the location we wish to perform the positioning in must be configured in the system. For Estimote, this is done using the \texttt{ESTLocationBuilder} as described in section \ref{sec:indoor-positioning:estimote}. The location builder is sufficient from a developers perspective but configuring locations in code is likely not intuitive for the target group. Instead we propose an alternative way to configure locations.

As a minimum, Estimote must be configured with the walls of a location as the beacons are attached to a wall. We propose a smartphone application in which users can draw the walls in their home on the touchscreen of the phone. This requires users to measure the length of the walls in their home and then plot it on their smartphone. For improved accuracy users can fine tune the length of walls by selecting a wall and entering the length in centimeters.

Having configured the walls of the room, the user needs to configure the locations of each beacon. The first thing he should do, is to install the beacons on the actual walls, i.e. not the virtual representation of his home.
Using the smartphone application, the user can drag a virtual beacon into the representation of his home and place it on one of the previously configured walls. He should do so for each installed beacon.

The Estimote Indoor SDK must know the MAC address of each positioned beacon in order to do the positioning. Using Estimotes regular SDK, i.e. not the Indoor SDK, signal strengths and MAC addresses for all beacons can be retrieved. Based on the signal strengths, we can determine which beacon the user is closest to and assign its MAC address to the previously positioned beacon. This requires the user to walk along the perimeter of the location when configuring the beacons in order to be closer to the relevant beacon than the rest.

Knowing the layout of the room and the position of the beacons, we can start positioning the user and the only thing left is to configure the location of each actuator in order to determine the relative location of the user and the actuator. We can utilize the position of the user when configuring the position of each actuator. The user can walk to each actuator he desires to add to the system, press a button to add it and for further reference provide some information about the actuator, e.g. a name.

Figure \ref{fig:configuration-location:add-room} shows a mock up of software that can be used to configure a location. Note that this software was not implemented during the project. The first mock up shows the process of drawing the location. The user can use the pencil to draw walls and the erase tool to remove entire walls. Tapping on the lengths will present a keyboard allowing the user to adjust the lengths. Note that the length of the first wall must be specified manually in order to determine relative lengths when the user draws the following walls.

In the second image the beacon tool is enabled and the pencil tool and eraser tool are dsiabled. The user should position beacons on the walls by dragging a beacon from the bottom onto a wall.

The final image shows the user walking around placing actuators. Actuators are represented by a circle and two has been placed in the image. Recently one was placed at the users current location therefore a circle has been put around the user. Tapping an actuator lets the user add information about the actuator, e.g. a name. Pressing the done button will save the location.

Locations are created and saved using the \texttt{ESTLocationBuilder}. Whenever a location is saved, it is stored in the Estimote cloud and is available on all the users devices. In order to authenticate an account with Estimote, the user must log into Estimote on cloud.estimote.com, create an application and enter the returned application token into the settings of the smartphone application.
