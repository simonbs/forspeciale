\section{Architecture}\label{sec:architecture}
The system consists of three layers as illustrated in \Cref{fig:architecture}. 
Each layer can communicate with the layer below and above it if they exist.

The first layer consist of the wearable device and the smartphone. 
The two may be tightly coupled as some wearable watches, 
for example the Apple Watch, relies heavily on the phone. 
The two devices are responsible for listening to new movement data from the wearable, 
\eg new data from the accelerometer and the magnetometer.
The movement data is used for recognizing gestures, 
and the magnetometer data is used for determining direction, 
such that we are able to determine what devices are being pointed at. 
The topmost layer is also responsible for communicating with the beacons, 
in order to retrieve the position of the user, 
and possibly the position of the devices the user can control. 

The topmost layer communicates with a central server developed specifically for this project. 
The server is responsible for storing positions of the smart devices, 
as well as receiving actions, based on interpreted gestures, from the wearable device.
Whenever the wearable device recognizes a gesture, 
the wearable devices sends an action and a device ID to the server.
The server then relays this request to a smart hub. 

The smart hub is responsible for managing the devices that can be controlled using gestures. 
The smart execute the request received from the server, 
on the appropriate smart device. 

When utilizing a smart hub, users must install a hub in their home. 
The hub communicates with the users devices, \eg bulbs, locks and thermostats. 
For privacy reasons, it may be interesting to move the logic of the server to the smart hubs in the users home. 
This would also remove a layer in the architecture, simplifying it.

The following components are involved in the architecture:
\begin{description}
    \item[Werable Device] Recognizes gestures and ensures actions are sent. For more information on gesture recognition, see \Cref{sec:gesturerecognition}. Not included in the implemented prototypes; gesture recognition is performed on a smartphone in out implementation. See \Cref{chap:implementation} for reasons why. 
    \item[Smartphone] Responsible for performing indoor positioning using the beacons. Possibly serves as a medium of communication between the wearable and the server, as some wearable devices require a coupled smartphone.
    \item[Beacons] Utilized for indoor positioning. For more information on this see \Cref{sec:designindoorlocation}.
    \item[Server] A medium of communication between layer (1) and layer (3). For more information about the server, see \Cref{sec:serverdesign}.
    \item[Smart Hub] The hub responsible for communicating with the smart devices. For more information on the smart hub, see \Cref{sec:designsmarthub}.
\end{description}

In the architecture presented in \Cref{fig:architecture}, 
the server is separated from the smart hub. 
In the current prototype, 
the components are physically separated. 
In practice it makes sense to bundle the two components together, 
and keep a virtual separation. 
Based on the current solution, 
the user must install both a server and a smart hub in his home. 
Bundling the two together eases the installation, 
as only a single component will need to be installed, 
and configured by the user.

One way of bundling the two components, 
is to extend the smart hub with the capabilities of the server.
Such solution is not possible with other hubs, such as SmartThings.
In order to bundle with such smart hubs, 
the capabilities of our server must be implemented by the company making the smart hub.
