\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:evaluation}
This chapter describes the tests and experiments we setup in order to evaluate our solution. 
We setup \num{4} tests, one in each of the following sections. 
The first test, described in \Cref{sec:gestureperformance}, we perform is to measure the performance of the gesture recognizer described in \Cref{ref to Gesture Recognizer}. 
Then we evaluate the correctness of the gesture recognizer in \Cref{sec:gesturecorrectness}.
To test the precision of our indoor location, we perform precision tests on the Estimote SDK in \Cref{sec:estimoteprecision}.
Finally we test the system as a whole in \Cref{sec:systemcorrectness}.
