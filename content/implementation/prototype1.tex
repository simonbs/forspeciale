\subsection{Prototype \#1}
\label{sec:implementation:prototypes:prototype1}

The purpose of the first prototype was to quickly test how it can be detected which devices users point at given their position and the direction they are facing along with the underlying math.

The first prototype was an Android phone application, 
that showed the devices that the user pointed at.
The application used a $10 \times 10$ grid to simulate a square room, 
in which the user and the devices to be controlled were located.
A set of imaginary devices was hardcoded into the application with fixed positions, 
and the grid would look like the one shown in \Cref{table/prototype-grid}.
The user is positioned in the center at $(5,5)$ by default. 
This position can be changed by using the \texttt{Up}, \texttt{Down}, \texttt{Left} and \texttt{Right} buttons.
When the user's direction changes, 
a list of devices being pointed at is acquired, 
by calculating the angle between the user's position and the position of each device.
The direction is found using magnetic fields, 
such that \num{0} is north, \num{-90} is west, \num{90} is east, etc. 
The angle between each smart device and the user, 
is calculated finding the inverse tangent (arctangent), 
and then converting from radians to degrees (dividing \num{180} by $\pi$), 
such that we get:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:angle}
\var{angle} = 180 / \pi * \arctan(\var{user.y} - \var{device.y} / \var{user.x} - \var{device.x})
\end{equation}
where \var{user.x} and \var{user.y} are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the user and likewise for the device.
A screenshot of this application is shown in \Cref{fig:prototype1-app-screenshots}.

\subsubsection{Results}

From the prototype we found that given the users position, their direction and the positions of smart devices we can determine which smart devices a user points at. We were also able to determine the math needed to check which smart devies the user points at.

Based on this we can expand the prototype to work with dynamically loaded devices and perform actions on the smart devices being pointed at.
