\section{Prototype \#1}
\label{sec:implementation:prototypes:prototype1}
The purpose of the first prototype, 
was to quickly test how to detect which devices users point at, 
given the user's position and the direction the user is facing, 
along with the underlying math.

\subsection{Description}
The first prototype was an Android phone application, 
that showed the devices that the user pointed at.
The application used a $10 \times 10$ grid to simulate a square room, 
in which the user and the devices to be controlled were located.
A set of imaginary devices was hardcoded into the application with fixed positions, 
and the grid would look like the one shown in \Cref{table/prototype-grid}.
The user is positioned in the center at $(5,5)$ by default. 
This position can be changed by using the \texttt{Up}, \texttt{Down}, \texttt{Left} and \texttt{Right} buttons.
When the user's direction changes, 
a list of devices being pointed at is acquired, 
by calculating the angle between the user's position and the position of each device.
The direction is found using magnetic fields\todo[author=Brian]{Kan højtalere og andre magnetiske felter forstyrre magnetometeret så det ikke længere er præcist nok?}, 
such that \num{0} is north, \num{-90} is west, \num{90} is east, etc. 

The angle between each smart device and the user, 
is calculated by \Cref{eq:angle} from \Cref{sec:analysis:orientation}:
\begin{equation}
\var{angle} = 180 / \pi * \arctan(\var{user.y} - \var{device.y} / \var{user.x} - \var{device.x})
\end{equation}
where \var{user.x} and \var{user.y} are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the user and likewise for the device.
A screenshot of this application is shown in \Cref{fig:prototype1-app-screenshots}.

\subsection{Results}
\todo[author=Brian]{Skriv noget om hvor præcist det var.}
From the prototype we found that given the user's position, 
the user's direction (from a magnetometer) and the positions of smart devices, 
we can determine which smart devices a user points at. 
We were also able to determine the math needed to check which smart devices the user points at.

Based on this we can expand the prototype, 
to work with dynamically loaded devices, 
and perform actions on the smart devices being pointed at.
