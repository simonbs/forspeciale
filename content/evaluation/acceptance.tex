\section{Acceptance Testing}\label{sec:acceptancetesting}
Acceptance tests are larger, multi-object tests and provide a way for us to assure that the system, as a whole, behaves in the way our criteria outline.

They also provide a useful testing ground for setting up different scenarios and seeing the results they yield, such as comparing the production results of \num{10} windmills compared to \num{1000} windmills.
