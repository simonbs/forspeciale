\section{Overall System Correctness}\label{sec:systemcorrectness}
This test is designed to test the system as a whole. 
We want to test how many times the system:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sends the right action to the right device
    \item Sends the wrong action to the right device
    \item Sends the right action to the wrong device
    \item Sends the wrong action to the wrong device
\end{enumerate}
Thus this test is meant to total correctness of our system. 

We have the following setup, also illustrated in \Cref{fig:totalcorrectness}:
[SETUP: Which devices, where they are, where we stand, etc.]

We send a total of [NUMBER OF GESTURES]. 
\Cref{table:correctnessresults} shows the results of this test.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|cc}
                     & Right action & Wrong Action \\ \hline
        Right Device &      x       &     z        \\
        Wrong Device &      y       &     w        \\
    \end{tabular}
