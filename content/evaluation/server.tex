\section{Server and HomePort}\label{sec:servereval}
This section briefly describes the evaluation of the implemented server and HomePort. 

The server has not been tested in detail, 
as the number of the requests send to and from the server is small,
and the complexity of the requests are simple. 
We have experienced no problems with the server during development,
or through testing the application. 

HomePort on the other hand have showed problems. 
The implementation of HomePort that we use, 
is the so-called OldHomePort\footnote{\url{https://github.com/home-port/HomePort/tree/OldHomePort}}. 
We used this version as it was the only one with a phidget adapter implemented. 
Through testing we have found that this version of HomePort crash a lot when receiving requests. 
Sometimes it will even disconnect the phidget interface kit, 
and thus all the devices, at seemingly random points of time. 
We have not worked on determining the errors of OldHomePort, 
nor have we tried to debug it. 
This is primarily because it is a third-party component of our system, 
and have only been used to properly test the communication between the devices and the phone.
