We are using the \$3 Gesture Recognizer and they have in their paper, 
presenting the recognition system, performed this test \cite{threedollar}.
They had \num{12} volunteers testing the system with a Nintendo Wii remote, 
on a set of \num{8} unique gestures (defined in their paper).
They post a result of a correctness rate of \perc{80}. 
They also post a clear difference between the volunteers, 
where the best score was a correctness rate of \perc{98} and the worst score was \perc{58}. 
\subsection{Correctness Rate of Gesture Recognition Conclusion}
From the results, we can conclude that the \$3 Gesture Recognizer is adequate for this project, but leaves room for improvement.
