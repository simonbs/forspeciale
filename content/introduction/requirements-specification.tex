\section{Requirements Specification}
\label{sec:requirements-specification}

In this section we will list the requirements that the system we develop must fullfil.

\subsection{Users should be able to set up a room}
The user needs to be able to specify the positions of the Estimote beacons in a room, as well as the shape and size of the room. They should be able to do this for multiple rooms so they can use the system in their entire home.

\subsection{Users should be able to add smart items to a room}
If the user is performing a first time setup or has acquired a new smart item in his home, he needs to be able to add it to the room.

\subsection{Users should be able to specify the position of a smart item by using his own position}
The user should be able to configure a position of a smart item by standing next to it and clicking an ``Assign Location'' button.

This is needed first time the user adds a smart item to a room, but also when a smart item is moved or removed.

\subsection{Users should be able to create their own gestures}
The user needs to be able to create new gestures and train them.

\subsection{Users should be able to assign a gesture to an action}
The user should be able to link a gesture to a certain action, eg. \textit{Clockwise circle} turns up the stereo.

\subsection{Users should be able to control smart items by pointing at them and performing a gesture}
The system needs to detect when a user is pointing at smart items, determine which items are being pointed at and react to any gestures performed.
