\section{Indoor Positioning}\label{sec:indoor-positioning}
One of the most discussed or wanted features in an automated smart home, 
is having the smart home detect where you are.
There are multiple use cases for this feature, 
not only in smart homes, but also in a lot of other settings. 
A few examples of where indoor positioning, or location, can be useful:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Indoor navigation (\eg in large publics buildings such as airports or hospitals)
    \item Tracking of patients in \eg hospitals or elderly care facilities
    \item Finding lost objects such as keys in a home
    \item Tracking people in smart homes to execute certain actions when a person is near an object or an area
\end{enumerate}
