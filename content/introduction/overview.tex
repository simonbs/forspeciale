\section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}
This section will briefly describe the structure and the content of the report. This report consists of 5 chapters and should be read from Chapter 1 to Chapter 5. The first chapter, \Cref{chap:introduction}, which you have just read, was an introduction to the problem domain, briefly explaining the most important topics that are needed to fully understand the rest of this report. In \Cref{chap:design} we further analyze the problem and design our system by first describing a solution model and then analyze how we can design each component needed. The system's implementation (our solution) will be described in \Cref{chap:implementation} to show how the important components are implemented using actual code snippets. Then we test our system in \Cref{chap:evaluation} to see if it really does what we want it to and to evaluate on the results of the tests. Lastly, we end this report by making a conclusion in \Cref{chap:conclusion} where we show the final results, and then discuss these results and how the system may be further improved.
