\section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}
This section will briefly describe the structure and the content of rest of the report. 
This report consists of 5 chapters and should be read from Chapter 1 to Chapter 5. 
The first chapter, \Cref{chap:introduction}, which you have just read, 
was an introduction to the problem domain, 
briefly exploring existing technologies in the area of IoT. 
In \Cref{chap:analysis} we further analyze the problem, 
and which solutions exist.
\Cref{chap:design} describes the architecture and design of our system. 
The system's implementation, and prototypes during the project, 
will be described in \Cref{chap:implementation}, 
to show how the important components are implemented using actual code snippets. 
Then we test our system in \Cref{chap:evaluation} to see if it really does what we want it to, 
and to evaluate on the results of the tests. 
Lastly, we end this report by making a conclusion in \Cref{chap:conclusion}, 
where we show the final results, 
and then discuss these results and how the system may be further improved.
