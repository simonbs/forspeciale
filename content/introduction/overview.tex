\section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}
This section will briefly describe the structure and the content of rest of the report. 
This report consists of 6 chapters and should be read from Chapter 1 through Chapter 6. 
The first chapter, \Cref{chap:introduction}, which you have just read, 
was an introduction to the problem domain, 
briefly exploring existing technologies in the area of IoT. 
In \Cref{chap:analysis} we further analyze the problem, 
and existing solutions.
\Cref{chap:design} describes the architecture and design of our system. 
The system's implementation, and prototypes during the project, 
will be described in \Cref{chap:implementation}.
Then we evaluate our system in \Cref{chap:evaluation}, 
to see if it meets the requirements from \Cref{sec:requirements-specification}.
Lastly, we end this report by making a conclusion in \Cref{chap:conclusion}, 
where we show and discuss the final results, 
and discuss how the system may be further improved.
