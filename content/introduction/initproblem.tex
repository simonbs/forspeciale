\section{Initializing Problem}\Cref{sec:initproblem}
With the Internet of Things, 
we can now gather much more information using the sensors on smart devices, especially wearables. 

Wearables can provide information about the users,
such as temperature and heart rate, 
but this information is usually only being used by the users to analyze their own habits, 
for fun and interest. 

If we can somehow use this information to automate homes, 
we could increase comfort or improve health of the users. 
For example, could it be possible to use the user's body temperature, 
to regulate the house temperature.

We have access to a lot of information that is hardly being used, 
gathered from \eg wearables,
and we have a lot of other technology in terms of home automation.
It could be interesting to see if we can combine these technologies, 
to create something new to help the users.
