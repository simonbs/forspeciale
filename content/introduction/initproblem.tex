\section{Initializing Problem}\Cref{sec:initproblem}
With the Internet of Things, 
we can now gather much more information using the sensors on smart devices, especially wearables. 

Wearables can provide information about the users,
such as temperature and heart rate, 
but this information is usually only being used by the users to analyze their own habits, 
for fun and interest. 

Can we somehow use this information to help the users, 
to automate homes to increase comfort or improve health?
Could it for example be possible to use the user's body temperature, 
to regulate the house temperature?
What information can we actually gather from wearables and other smart devices? 
How is the information currently being used, 
aside from for fun and interest? 
What is the current state of IoT, wearables and smart homes? 

We have access to a lot of information that is hardly being used,
\emph{but how do we utilize this information?}
