\section{Research Statement}
In the previous sections we analyzed different areas of Internet of Things (IoT) including how wearables and home automation are maturing. 
We have seen some of the possibilities of wearables and we can see that this can integrated with home automation and indoor location.
We think that exploring the concept of home automation with wearables can result in a usable system that better utilizes the devices for smart homes by giving a better interface. 
More accurately, we want to:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explore the possibilities of interconnecting smart devices using existing technologies  
        \item Give users a better interface of controlling smart devices with gestures using a wearable in a smart home 
    \end{itemize}    
\end{quote}

The goal of our research is to create a system that allows gesture-based communication between the user and smart devices.
We feel that allowing users to point and control devices will give the best interface. 
This approach requires accurate indoor location, a wearable that can recognize gestures and a hub for interoperability between the wearable and the smart devices.
