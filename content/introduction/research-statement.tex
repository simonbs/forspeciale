\section{Problem Statement}
In the previous sections we analyzed different areas of Internet of Things (IoT) including how wearables and home automation are maturing. 
We have seen some of the possibilities of wearables and we can see that this can integrated with home automation and indoor location.
We think that exploring the concept of home automation with wearables can result in a usable system that better utilizes the devices for smart homes by giving a better interface. 
More accurately, we want to explore the possibilities of interconnecting smart devices using existing technologies.
In the remainder of this report, we will answer the following question:
\begin{framed}
    \begin{quote}
        What can we do with wearables and smart devices in a smart home setting, where different smart devices may use different communication protocols?
        
        In answering this question, we will also answer the following questions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What problems arise when working with different platforms using different operating systems?
            \item Which limitations does current technology have in the area of IoT? Can we overcome it and how? 
           \end{itemize}

%The goal of our research is to create a system that allows gesture-based communication between the user and smart devices.
%We feel that allowing users to point and control devices will give the best interface. 
%This approach requires accurate indoor location, a wearable that can recognize gestures and a hub for interoperability between the wearable and the smart devices.
