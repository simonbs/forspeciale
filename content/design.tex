\chapter{Analysis \& Design}\label{chap:design}\label{chap:analysis}
In this chapter we will further analyze the problem and design a solution to the problem. The implementation of this solution will be found in \Cref{chap:implementation}.

\Cref{sec:solapproach} introduces the solution we want to design towards. This section is very abstract and the full design of it comes in the following sections. Before we start designing the main components of the system, we describe the environment and the situation in \Cref{sec:scenario}. We then design some of the smaller components based on the components from the problem domain in \Cref{sec:components}. One of the main components in our solution is a forecaster that forecasts energy supply and energy prices, which will be described in \Cref{sec:timeseriesforecasting}. Lastly in \Cref{sec:desScheduling}, we design the other main component: the scheduler. Besides designing the scheduler, we also formalize our problem as a optimization problem.
