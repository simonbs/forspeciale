\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

This chapter concludes on the solution described in this report and implemented in the project. The basis of the conclusion is the requirement specification presented in section \ref{sec:requirements-specification} and the problem statement presented in section \ref{sec:researchstatement}. Each requirement will be evaluated in order to determine to what degree the requirement was fulfilled.

Based on the requirement specification, the conclusion and the evaluation from chapter \ref{chap:evaluation}, we will present seven broad aspects of the system that can be improved in future work.
